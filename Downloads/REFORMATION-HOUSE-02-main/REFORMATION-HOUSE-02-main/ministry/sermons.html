                    <p>When people talk about the “Godhead,” 
                        they often use the term “Trinity” in 
                        
                        reference to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. 
                        The term “Trinity” is not in the Bible; however, 
                        that does not necessarily mean that the concept is unbiblical. 
                        Yet many believe that there is just one person of God and deny 
                        the concept of the “Trinity.”

In this article, we are going to look at what the Bible teaches about the Godhead – 
what it means and whether there are three persons of God or just one.

The Meaning of “Godhead”
The term “Godhead” is used three times in the Bible:

“Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device” (Acts 17:29, KJV).

“For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse” (Romans 1:20, KJV).

“For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily” (Colossians 2:9, KJV).

Other translations (NASB, NIV, ESV) use different terms in place of “Godhead” – divine nature/being (Acts 17:29), divine nature (Romans 1:20), and deity (Colossians 2:9). These are helpful in understanding the meaning of the term.

“Godhead” is about nature or possessing the characteristics of God. Another term that may be easier to understand would be “Godhood.” This would be similar to “manhood” or “brotherhood” – possessing the characteristics of “men” or “brethren.” Those in the “Godhead” are part of the “Godhood” – possessing the characteristics of God.

            } else if (sermonId === 'sermon2') {
                modalTitle.textContent = 'Sermon Title 2';
                modalContent.innerHTML = `
                    <p>PThe idea was clearly expressed that there was only one God. He commanded the people, 
                        “You shall have no other gods before Me” (Exodus 20:3). This would have been different 
                        from the surrounding nations who served many “gods” (cf. Joshua 24:14-15).

In the first century, the Gentile nations also served many “gods.
” When Paul was in Athens “his spirit was being provoked within 
him as he was observing the city full of idols” (Acts 17:16). 
In writing to the brethren in Corinth, Paul said there were
 “so-called gods…many gods and many lords” (1 Corinthians 8:5).

However, the New Testament plainly teaches that there is one God. 
Paul described the idols as “so-called gods” because “there is no such thing as an idol in the world, 
and that there is no God but one” (1 Corinthians 8:4-5). He added, “There is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him” (1 Corinthians 8:6). He told the Ephesians that there is “one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all” (Ephesians 4:6).</p>
